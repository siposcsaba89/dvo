# Roadmap

Goal: fast direct sparse VO for driving data, producing poses + a semi-dense point cloud
to initialise neural surface reconstruction / Gaussian Splatting instead of COLMAP.

| Step | Content | Validation |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Skeleton, CMake/vcpkg, KITTI reader, image pyramid, trajectory evaluation (ATE, Sim3/SE3 align) | unit tests, loads seq 00 |
| 2 | Photometric residual model: residual pattern, affine brightness (a,b), Huber weighting, analytic Jacobians | numeric-vs-analytic Jacobian tests |
| 3 | Coarse frame tracking: pyramid direct alignment against keyframe depth, motion hypotheses | track with GT-free stereo depth on KITTI |
| 4 | Candidate point selection (region-adaptive gradient threshold) + immature points (epipolar search, depth interval) | visual checks, depth vs stereo |
| 5 | Monocular initialisation | first N frames |
| 6 | Sliding-window photometric bundle adjustment, Schur complement, marginalisation with FEJ | synthetic tests, then KITTI |
| 7 | Keyframe + point management (creation, activation, outlier removal, marginalisation strategy) | full pipeline on KITTI 00 |
| 8 | Export: poses + points in COLMAP text format (cameras/images/points3D) for GS / NeuS | load in a GS trainer |
| 9 | Stereo extension (metric scale, better for driving) | KITTI ATE in metres |
| 10 | Performance: multithreading, SIMD | real-time on KITTI |
